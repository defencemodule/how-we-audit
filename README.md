# how-we-audit

1. Defence Module offers smart contract security audits to help companies ensure the safety and security of their blockchain-based applications.

2. We begin by conducting a thorough review of the smart contract code and architecture, working closely with your team throughout the proccess to ensure we understand the intention of the code as well as the functionality of the code.

3. We then assess the security of the smart contract using our proprietary and open source security analysis tools.

4. Once the security analysis is complete, we provide a detailed report with our findings and recommendations.

5. We also offer ongoing security monitoring and support to help companies keep their smart contracts safe and secure.
